## **Hi**, I'm Tim Turvey

### A bit about me...  
I'm a mechanical engineering university graduate, ex-financial auditor and a December 2021 graduate of one of the best coding boot camps in London, Makers Academy. In August 2021 I made the decision to switch careers to become a software developer. The problem-solving nature of coding is what I attracted me in the first place but the potential for me to have an impact on people and the world is what will keep me here for years to come. Tech is the future and I am happy to be a part of it!

Since making the career change, I haven't looked back. I've come along way from knowing almost nothing last year to now being fully proficient in Ruby and JavaScript and able to build my own projects. For a more comprehensive list of things I have learnt whilst at Makers, see the [education](#education) section below. 

I'm a fast learner and easy to get on with. Please reach out if you have any opportunities for an inspired and motivated software dev!
