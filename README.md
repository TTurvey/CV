## Tim Turvey

Mechanical engineering university graduate, ex-financial auditor and current student at Makers Academy. In August 2021 I made the decision to switch careers to become a software developer. After having learnt to code in Ruby in a matter of weeks, I am committed to being fully proficient in both Ruby and JavaScript in December 2021 after having graduated one of the best coding bootcamps in London. Tech is the future and I am happy to be a part of it!
