## **Hi**, I'm Tim Turvey

### A bit about me...  
I'm a [mechanical engineering](#education) university graduate, [ex-financial auditor](#workexperience) and a December 2021 [graduate](#education) of one of the top coding boot camps in London, Makers Academy. In August 2021 I made the decision to switch careers to become a software developer. The problem-solving nature of coding is what attracted me in the first place but the potential for me to have an impact on people and the world is what will keep me here for years to come. Tech is the future and I am happy to be a part of it!

Since changing careers, I haven't looked back. I've come along way from knowing almost nothing last year to now being fully proficient in Ruby and JavaScript. I'm capable of building my own projects such as a [minesweeper](#projects) game. For a more comprehensive list of things I have learnt whilst at Makers, see the [education](#education) section below. 

Please have a look at my [Github](www.github.com/TTurvey) to see how I have progressed over time. I'm a fast learner and easy to get on with. Please reach out if you have any opportunities for an inspired and motivated software developer!

| Bar.io<br/> [backend repo](https://github.com/TTurvey/bar.io-backend) <br/> [frontend repo](https://github.com/TTurvey/bar.io-frontend)  | A bar finder web app that returns the top 5 rated bars within a selectable walking distance of the user’s current location. This was built in a team of 4 developers as our final project of the Makers Academy boot camp. The app uses Google Maps, Places and Geocoding API’s. The backend was built using Node.js and Express to create a RESTful API whilst React was used on the frontend. Unit testing was carried out with Jest. | React, Node.js, Express  |  
| [Minesweeper game](https://github.com/TTurvey/minesweeper-javascript) | A web based Minesweeper game. JavaScript was used for DOM manipulation and the deliberate implementation of recursion.  |  Javascript, Node.js, Express  | 
| [Chitter (Twitter clone)](https://github.com/TTurvey/chitter-challenge)  | Created a clone of the popular Twitter app that utilises user authentication and PostgreSQL databases.  | Ruby, rspec, Sinatra  |

## Skills
---

**<ins>Problem-solving</ins>**  
- I can find solutions to complex problems which is very useful as a software developer.
- I recently built a [minesweeper](#projects) game with JavaScript. I chose to build this game because I knew it would be hard to code the automatic revealing of squares when a square with the number zero in it is clicked. With great challenge, comes a great learning opportunity though, and in this case I learnt how recursion could solve this issue - problem solved. 
- Please find the minesweeper game repository [here](https://github.com/TTurvey/minesweeper-javascript).


**<ins>Communication</ins>**  
- I'm able to understand complex topics and communicate them clearly to others.
- As part of our final group project on the Makers coding boot camp, we had to give a talk on the project to our cohort and others.
- As a team, we split the information down into related sections, divided the sections between ourselves and presented our work.
- The information was conveyed clearly to people that did not have any prior understanding of the technology or code.


**<ins>Teamwork / Collaboration</ins>**  
- I can work effectively in a team in either a junior or senior role.  
- In my last job as a financial auditor I was a senior and managed junior colleagues on multiple audit teams.  
- I controlled the amount and difficulty of their workload in order to maximise their effectiveness and minimise down time.  
- I ensured fieldwork went smoothly by helping with any problems the team had.
